You'll make both the front and Back end of a junior school's web app. https://www.facebook.com/share/qycatvBG9eEpZBRW/?mibextid=qi2Omg


Here are key functionalities.
1. Parents Portal
2. Contact Form
3. News feed
4. Resource Page

PARENT'S PORTAL
- A username and password is provided by the admin, (username could be the child's admission number or otherwise)
- The parent can view their fee statements and download it.
- The parent can be able to send and receive direct message from the portal. 
(Think of other creative ways to enhance the parents Portal)

CONTACT FORM
- The query should be received on an email.
- This is where visitors to the website can send queries

NEWS FEED
- On the homepage, design a popup slider for the news capturing upcoming events, important news that should can be made public (remember those that can't be public will be publicized through parent's portal)
- Have a news page where all these news and events can be accessed, filtered by either term, academic year and so on

RESOURCE PAGE
A page for all downloadable materials - design upload functionality for admin and
download page where all pdf are visible and downloadable
NB: Think if it's really necessary since news feed and the portal might handle this)
